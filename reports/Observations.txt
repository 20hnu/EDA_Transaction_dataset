* Duplicates: 0 rows
* Missing values:
    • acqCountry (3913)
    • merchantCountryCode (624)
    • posEntryMode (3345)
    • posConditionCode (287)
    • transactionType (589)
* Handling Missing Values
    - Since ”acqCountry” and ”merchantCountrycode” contains same values for each row
but there are around 623 rows which have missing values for both columns. Hence
these rows are removed.
    - Remaining value for ”merchantCountryCode” is imputed with the help of ”acqCountry” and vice-versa
    - Missing ”transactionType” values are imputed by most frequent type i.e ”PURCHASE”
    - Rows containing missing values for ”posEntryMode” and ”posConditionCode” are
removed.
* DateTime columns are converted into pandas date time format.
* New features are added as day, hour and month of transactionDateTime.
* cross_border_count feature is added, which represents different merchantCountryCode and acqCountry for a transaction.
* Final dataset is converted into shape of (637666, 27).


* accountNumber and customerID are same for each row.
* Number of unique accountNumber or customerId is 5000.
* Most common account Numbers are 318001076 (9977 transactions), 456044564 (8339 transactions) and 812328116 (5461 transactions) among 5000 customers.
